# Lab A - Logging In

## Background

We've taken the liberty of spinning up some bare metal infrastructure for you to use in this lab. 
Each student has been allocated a number of bare metal hosts with Kubernetes and Rook already installed.
In this first lab, you'll be verifying that you can log into all the physical bare metal, the 
Kubernetes environment, and the Rook/Ceph management interface.

## Logging In



## Next Steps

Once you're done, proceed to [Lab-B](Lab-B.md)
